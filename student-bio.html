    <p>Hello everyone, my name is Blair Brownlie-Edward and I am a student in the university of Arizona coding bootcamp.
        I'm going to take this time to tell you all about myself. My favorite color is red and as such, I am a massive
        liverpool fan! I love to play video games and right now I'm addicted to Kingdom Hearts 3, but I also dabble in
        first person shooters as well.</p>
    <p>When I'm not playing video games you can either find me working or playing music! I've been working as a courier
        for almost 2 years now and I really like the hours. Personally, I've been playing music since I was about 9 or
        10 years old. My favorite instruments include the piano, ukulele, and guitar. In terms of goals, I'd like to
        become a software engineer in my future and also learn how to play the drums.</p>
